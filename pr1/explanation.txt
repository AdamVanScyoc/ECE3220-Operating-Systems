Program 1: parsefiles.sh 
(see also attached output.txt)

parsefiles.sh is A fault-tolerant, self contained bash script that parses the ls 
outputs of several files systems (fs1 and fs2). It does this by combing through these 
ls outputs (which are stored as text), and processing that text
by extracting relevant fields and processing the data in a particular way.

The files that contain the text output of the ls command (of the files systems we are dealing with)
 are first listed by the bash command "find" with several arguements that narrow down the relevant files - which are different
in the cases of fs1 and fs2 respectively. 
Next, the command "grep" is used to retrieve all lines from these
text files that contain a file name with an extension that matches a certain pattern.
The output of the grep command is provided as input to the awk command, which allows
us to view only files from a specified time period (any time, between during the years 1990-1995, or pre-1995).
Finally, this is provided as input to the command 'wc -l', which count the number of lines matching this criteria,
and stores this number as the file count.

There are several nested loops allowing us to narrow are search by time frame and by fs1 versus fs2.
