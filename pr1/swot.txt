Program 1 SWOT

1) SWOT for Lights

It is techinically possible to have every light fixture accessible as a Linux-style
device file (i.e. "/dev/*") as part of the Internet of Things. These lights would 
have hardware added that provided an internet uplink. The organization of this network 
of lights could be in the form of a file system. For example, there could be a directory
for the Clemson Campus that the fixture exists in, the building, the floor, and the room 
number or name, and then a UID for the light. For example:
/dev/main/core/2/dininghall/2AE4
/dev/charleston/agriculturebuilding/0/foyer/F09C

2) SWOT for Dams

Something similar could be achieved with every dam in South Carolina. As in the previous case,
 this would involve some significant overhead, and many of the dams are remote -
 so a network connection would require a powerful signal. But this system would allow us to 
monitor the status of every individual device (also a benefit in the case of Clemson light fixtures).
A potential drawback (which also applies to Clemson light fixtures) is that these devices could
potentially be exposed to the general publix on the internet - which could allow disclosure of 
sensitive information or even malicious control of the devices/dams.
The dams could again be organized into a file-like hierarchy, in this case by county, and body of water, then with a UID, eg:
/dev/charleston/lakemarion/3AFC
For the Wallace Dam on the Oconee River (which is technically in Georgia)
/dev/morgan/oconeeriver/990E

You could even use the common name of the Oconee River Dam, "Wallace Dam", as a sort of
simlink:
WallaceDam -> /dev/morgan/oconeeriver/990E
